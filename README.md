# Halloween-Bash
I was one of the two developers for coding this project with a total of seven team members. This code was designed for planning a Halloween Bash. It is very basic Java programing. This code includes getting the user to interact to get their credit card number and then deciding the amounts they put towards different necessities for throwing a bash.
